# cuda-nbody-playground
A N-body particle simulation that's accelerated by CUDA. You can simulate more than just gravity...


## Constants (will remove this, this is so I know roughly the scaling)
Positions will be from [0, 1] in both x and y 
Velocity in the range of 0.001 to 0.01 per time step
dt = 1.0 to start with
Big G = 0.00001
mass = 1.0f
